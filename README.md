This project is a simple and stylish Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a modern dark theme. Unlike traditional weather applications that depend on external APIs, this app uses the browser’s geolocation feature to detect the user’s location and display a simulated weather experience. The background dynamically changes based on the time of day—showing a bright gradient in the morning, warm tones in the afternoon, and a starry theme at night—creating a unique and interactive feel. The user interface is fully responsive with smooth hover effects, glowing card designs, and a clean layout that enhances usability. Since it does not rely on external API keys, it works completely offline and can be opened directly in any browser without setup. This makes it a perfect beginner-friendly project for practicing frontend development while still delivering a polished and creative design.
